# What is RNN?

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data — data where order matters.

Unlike traditional neural networks (like feedforward or CNN), RNN has memory — it remembers information from previous inputs and uses it to influence the current output.

**Think of it like reading a sentence:**

  *“The dog is chasing the cat.”*

To understand the word “cat”, the model should remember the context of previous words like “The dog is chasing…”.

This is exactly what RNN does.

# Why we use RNN

RNNs are best used when:

* Order or time matters in data.

* Past information affects future predictions.

**Common applications:**

* **Text** → language modeling, sentiment analysis, translation

* **Time series** → stock prediction, weather forecasting

* **Speech** → speech recognition, music generation

* **Sensor data** → activity recognition
